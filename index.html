        <h2>Goals for the School of Engineering Program</h2>
        <p>As I embark on this journey at AltSchool Africa, my ultimate goal is to become a master craftsman in frontend
            engineering. I'm driven to develop a profound understanding of the building blocks of the web - HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript - and to become a proficient expert in cutting-edge frameworks like React, Typescript, or
            Vue.js.

            My passion is to design and build user interfaces that are not only visually stunning but also responsive,
            fast, and intuitive. I want to create digital experiences that leave a lasting impression on users and make
            their lives easier. To achieve this, I'm committed to honing my problem-solving skills, thinking critically,
            and collaborating seamlessly with others. I believe that by doing so, I'll thrive in even the most dynamic
            development environments.

            Ultimately, my dream is to emerge from this program as a skilled frontend engineer who can make a real
            impact on the digital products that shape our world. I'm excited to put in the hard work and dedication
            required to turn my vision into a reality.</p>
